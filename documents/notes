- load won't run prepareRecord() on input data
	- use read with id instead
- flexFields are not searchable
	- it's easy enough to add new fields to the code and templates

- column ordering on search results
	- pass columns to templator
		- db field name is key
		- value is [label, currently sorting?]
	- pass search results too
	- loop over columns printing url with &sort=name
	- search results must have fields in order associated with columns
